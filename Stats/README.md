How best to report 'risk'?

Here are some suggestions from Aoife McMahon (on behalf of the GWAS
Catalog, EBI, @GWASCatalog)

Risk can be reported in a number of different ways, including odds
ratio, hazard ratio, relative risk or percentage change. You need to
consider absolute risk vs relative risk, as your example suggests, if
the baseline risk is low (e.g. if it's a rare condition affecting 1%
of individuals) and you are at 2-fold increased risk, you'll still
only have 2% risk of having the condition. I suggest you have a look
here (https://realrisk.wintoncentre.uk) to get an overview of risk and
to see some best practices and suggestions for communicating risk.

Regarding risk scores, I suggest you read up on polygenic risk
scores. These reviews might be a good place to start:

I hope that helps!
